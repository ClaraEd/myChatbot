",Yes,"Anxiety since TIA Sept 2017. Retired early from work  as a teacher for autistic children due to ME. Worked a stressful job. Had a 'stress reaction' then.    Normally active--walks, swims, jogs. ME doesn't bother her too much now, just occasional sore muscle.    1) Stroke recurrence    Worried about her stroke recurrence.   Has no risk factors--'why me?'   Cannot take clopidogrel--ill.  can't take aspirin.  Dipyridamole only.  Gets wound up about being on a less effective drug.     Was anxious before TIA but much worse since--'much more difficult to get under control'  Gets wound up about small things. Seems to have GAD--see GAD-7  Wake up at 2-3am thinking about things.  She recognizes anxious symptoms and that they are  out-of-proportion.  Tried to divert attention, breathing exercise. Takes a walk.     2) worry about other things:  Her reaction to annoying neighbour  A recent example:  A lot of work being done at house and garden.  Neighbour is bad tempered.--conflict with neighbour.   Feelings: getting wound up--tense, heart rate rises, tense headache, nausea  Thoughts: shouldn't let him win; calm down; I can do it.  30minutes to calm down.  Behaviours: go out for a walk,  Think the whole thing through.   Now. Thinks she was overreacting. Not blaming neighbour. Would like to deal with this better, and not get herself so wound up.    Other triggers:   -husband, need to prepare how to phrase q before asking him about certain matter e.g. septic tank, in case he loses temper, or gets impulsive.  -describes husband as 'autistic'   -husband disappears and returns.   -husband knows he is too controlling of his temper.     Situations:  -social situation: ex colleague  in a few weeks time has to go to Nottingham, will get stressed.   Small talk is impossible and difficult.   Can't sleep, wound up, restlessness  'mulling over what was said other people'   Have to be careful--reactions caused in other people. Not afraid of being judged by others.        -'fear of stroke recurrence' every day  -had a cold recently, similar to before a TIA  -TIA: was ill for a day, picked up a Kindle, dropped it, left hand, talking garbage, 2 minutes.  2-3 days fully recover.   fatigued.

Main trigger to fear of stroke recurrence:  --no known risk factor  --NSAID--celecoxib, trigger of stroke  --hi cholesterol, on statin  --dipyridamole  --HTN    SH  Drive,  Gym--workout, aquaerobics, every week.   Walking, jogging,   busy.  Non-smoker, alcohol: 12 units.    Comfortable talking to husband about her emotions, he finds it difficult to deal with.
